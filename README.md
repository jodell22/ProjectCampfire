# Project Campfire ðŸ”¥

Project Campfire is a Discord-integrated Dungeons & Dragons companion bot designed to bring a seamless, multi-channel, story-driven experience to your campaigns. Built with GPT-4 integration, it splits gameplay into multiple channels (e.g. DM-only, players/world, out-of-character) to help manage narrative flow and world-building immersion.

The bot supports:
- Dynamic narrative responses powered by AI
- Player sheet integration and persistent character memory
- Channel-specific intelligence (DM secrecy vs public story)
- Modular deployment on Ubuntu using Ansible

Whether you're running an epic saga or just a one-shot with friends, Campfire makes it feel like you're huddled around the real thing.

*Let the stories burn bright.*
