# ProjectCampfire
Project Campfire is a Discord-integrated Dungeons &amp; Dragons companion bot designed to bring a seamless, multi-channel, story-driven experience to your campaigns. Built with GPT-4 integration, it splits gameplay into multiple channels (e.g. DM-only, players/world, out-of-character) to help manage narrative flow and world-building immersion.
